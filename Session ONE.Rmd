knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Basic Commands Practical

### Task 1: Creating an object that receives numbers: 1, 1.2, 1.4, ... , 4

```{r}
v1 <- seq(from=1, to=4, by=0.2) #sequence of numbers from 1 to 4 taking 0.2 steps
v1
```

### Task 2: What does  c(rep(1, 5), rep(2, 10)) do?

``` {r}
c(rep(1, 5), rep(2, 10)) #rep repeats numbers a certain amount of times
```
The code creates a vector that contains repeated numbers: 1 repeated 5 times and 2 repeated 10 times

### Task 3: Generate the following sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
``` {r}
rep(seq(from=1,to=5), 2)
```
